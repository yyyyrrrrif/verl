"""Sticky-session end-to-end with the REAL sticky_stat collector (no mocking).

``_router_config`` lists ``sticky_stat`` in ``collector_names``, so the patched
``_FakeCollectorManager`` builds a real ``Collector(CallbackTransport(self),
StickyDecoder)`` that registers ``on_acquire`` / ``on_servers_removed`` on the
Balancer — exactly the production path. The test does NOT register callbacks by
hand; it only injects metrics into the real ``DataStore`` and asserts routing
behaviour. This is the test that proves the Phase-1 statistic chain works
outside the unit-test seam.
